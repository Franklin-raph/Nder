            <h3>UX Techniques</h3>
            <p>Appstah is an Australian-based software engineering company whose 
                mission is to produce incredibly high quality and capable mobile 
                applications for individuals new to Tech, Startups, Businesses, 
                Government, and anyone with a tangible idea.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>While Appstah has successfully created a system to provide this service, 
                our challenge is the need to promote/market our services to our prospective 
                clients while making it fairly easy for our clients all over the world to send 
                us a message and check out our services with how we would play an important role 
                in their wonderful businesses or ideas.
                <p style="margin: 9px 0;">The primary business needs from the brief were:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; font-size: 18px;">
                    <li style="margin:7px 0;">We want a front where new clients can come and have a full idea of all our services and how we can help their businesses.</li>
                    <li>and then send us a direct message.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>We designed the Appstah website to provide users with detailed 
                information about their mobile app services and a means to send 
                a direct message to the company with details about their business or ideas and budget. 
                This would help establish a ground for the company to show mastery 
                in their area of operations, increase awareness of their services, 
                create a ground for negotiation, and ultimately make it easy for their 
                users to send a direct message to the company.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Competitor/Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>I conducted a competitor analysis to gain inspiration and identify best 
                practices for our website design. I began looking at the websites of 
                several other software engineering companies in Australia and then 
                the world including https://dreamwalk.com.au/, https://www.intellectsoft.net/, 
                https://litslink.com/, and https://www.arcadedevhouse.com.au/
            </p>
    
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>One common feature I identified across these websites was the placement of the
                 “Contact Button” in order to emphasize it as the main call to action. This was 
                 an important design pattern to consider in order to make it easier and more efficient 
                 for users to send a direct message or contact the company via other means like the such 
                 of Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="casePageFirstImage">
            <img src="/images/Rectangle 6.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="/images/Rectangle 6-1.jpg" alt="">
            <img src="/images/Rectangle 6-2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="casePageSecondInfo">
            <p>
                Another common design pattern I observed was that each software company prominently displayed 
                its mission statement at the beginning of its homepage. This was an important method to effectively 
                communicate each software company’s goal to the user and help them better understand what each company does.
                Similarly, I observed another design pattern that software companies had a direct message or contact us 
                designed at the end of their websites (homepage, services page, and about us page). This was done to help 
                the user send a direct message without the hassle of going to the contact page after being convinced about the company.
                On the services page, I noticed many software companies had a sketch or illustration to show a well-detailed 
                software development process in order to make the user understand the work and process put into the development of a mobile app.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Architecture and User Flow</h3>
            <p>Once I organized all my research and defined our solution, I created a user flow, which is the user 
                journey from start to finish without excess details. Then I created the initial Information Architecture 
                which I changed along the way. I did this to have a direct goal in mind and not to be distracted when 
                coming up with potential designs.

        <div class="casePageSecondInfo">
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>
                There wasn’t enough time for multiple sketches, so after sketching a single idea I went into 
                figma and made a digital sketch. I used the digital sketch for an interview with the CEO who 
                just wanted to include a mapto the homepage which I added before going to high fidelity design.
